Hi! I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at National University of Singapore advised by [Yang You](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~youy/), where I also completed my master's studies. I obtained my bachelor's degree in CS & EE from Huazhong University of Science and Technology supervised by [Xinggang Wang](https://xwcv.github.io/). Previously, I collaborated at [Pika](https://pika.art/about) with [Chenlin Meng](https://cs.stanford.edu/~chenlin/) and interned at [Colossal-AI](https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI) with [Jiarui Fang](https://fangjiarui.github.io/).

I am actively looking for **summer research internship in 2025**. Please feel free to reach out if there are any opportunities available.

Research
------

My current research mainly focuses on **efficient and scalable machine learning** through algorithm, parallelism, scheduling and compiler, recently with a primary emphasis on **video models acceleration**. 

I am always happy to chat about interesting research ideas, and looking for academic collaborations and interns. Please drop me an email if you are interested in collaborating with me.
