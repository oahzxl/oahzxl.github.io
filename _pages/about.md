Hello! I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at National University of Singapore advised by [Yang You](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~youy/). I also earned my M.S. in Computer Science from NUS. My academic journey began with the B.Eng. in Computer Science & Electronic Information from Huazhong University of Science and Technology supervised by [Xinggang Wang](https://xwcv.github.io/) and [Xiaojun Hei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=x9vhdoIAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research focuses on `efficient and scalable machine learning system` with a primary emphasis on the following areas:
* `Video Model Optimization`: Improve the efficiency of video models from the pespective of parallelism, scheduling and algorithm. [<a href="https://oahzxl.github.io/publications/#DSP">DSP</a>, <a href="https://oahzxl.github.io/publications/#PAB">PAB</a>]
* `Memory Optimization`: Leverage compiler and heterogeneous to achieve efficient memory usage. [<a href="https://oahzxl.github.io/publications/#AutoChunk">AutoChunk</a>, <a href="https://oahzxl.github.io/publications/#HeteGen">HeteGen</a>]
* `Distributed Optimization`: Explore novel parallelism and communication strategy to enhance efficiency. [<a href="https://oahzxl.github.io/publications/#FastFold">FastFold</a>]

Open-source Projects:
* [`VideoSys`](https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/VideoSys): An Easy and Efficient System for Video Generation
* [`FastFold`](https://github.com/hpcaitech/FastFold/tree/main): Optimizing AlphaFold Training and Inference on GPU Clusters
* [`ColossalAI`](https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI): Making large AI models cheaper, faster and more accessible

Previously, I played a pivotal role in an open-source training system [Colossal-AI](https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI) (with over 35k stars on GitHub). As one of the core contributors ([ranked 5th](https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI/graphs/contributors)), I actively participated and led the development of various parallelism strategies.

Feel free to reach out via email if you're interested in collaborating with me, especially for the  acceleration of AI applications!

I am actively looking for `summer research internship in 2025`. Please feel free to reach out if there are any opportunities available.
