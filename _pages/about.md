Hello! I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at National University of Singapore (NUS) advised by [Yang You](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~youy/), where I also earned my M.S. in Computer Science. I obtained my undergraduate degree  in CS & ECE from Huazhong University of Science and Technology supervised by [Xinggang Wang](https://xwcv.github.io/). Previously, I internd at [ColossalAI](https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI) with [Jiarui Fang](https://fangjiarui.github.io/).


I am actively looking for **summer research internship in 2025**. Please feel free to reach out if there are any opportunities available.

Research
------

My current research mainly focuses on **efficient and scalable machine learning system** recently with a primary emphasis on **video model acceleration**. I am always happy to chat about interesting research ideas, and looking for academic collaborations. Please drop me an email if you are interested in collaborating with me.
