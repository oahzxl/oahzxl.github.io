Hello! I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at National University of Singapore (NUS) advised by [Yang You](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~youy/), where I also earned my M.S. in Computer Science. I obtained my undergraduate degree  in CS & ECE from Huazhong University of Science and Technology supervised by [Xinggang Wang](https://xwcv.github.io/). Previously, I internd at [Pika](https://pika.art/about) with [Chenlin Meng](https://cs.stanford.edu/~chenlin/), and [ColossalAI](https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI) with [Jiarui Fang](https://fangjiarui.github.io/).


I am actively looking for **summer research internship in 2025**. Please feel free to reach out if there are any opportunities available.

Research
------

My current research mainly focuses on **efficient and scalable machine learning system** recently with a primary emphasis on **video model acceleration**. I am always happy to chat about interesting research ideas, and looking for academic collaborations. Please drop me an email if you are interested in collaborating with me.

Open-Source Projects
------

* [VideoSys](https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/VideoSys): An Easy and Efficient System for Video Generation
* * Project lead
* [ColossalAI](https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI): Making large AI models cheaper, faster and more accessible
* * Core contributor ([ranked 5th](https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI/graphs/contributors) by 2024)

Selected Pubilications ([all](https://xuefuzhao.github.io/publications/))
------

My research focuses on **efficient and scalable machine learning system** with a primary emphasis on the following areas:
* `Video Model Optimization`: Improve the efficiency of video models from the pespective of parallelism, scheduling and algorithm. [<a href="https://oahzxl.github.io/publications/#DSP">DSP</a>, <a href="https://oahzxl.github.io/publications/#PAB">PAB</a>]
* `Memory Optimization`: Leverage compiler and heterogeneous to achieve efficient memory usage. [<a href="https://oahzxl.github.io/publications/#AutoChunk">AutoChunk</a>, <a href="https://oahzxl.github.io/publications/#HeteGen">HeteGen</a>]
* `Distributed Optimization`: Explore novel parallelism and communication strategy to enhance efficiency. [<a href="https://oahzxl.github.io/publications/#FastFold">FastFold</a>]


Previously, I played a pivotal role in an open-source training system [Colossal-AI](https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI) (with over 35k stars on GitHub). As one of the core contributors ([ranked 5th](https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI/graphs/contributors)), I actively participated and led the development of various parallelism strategies.
